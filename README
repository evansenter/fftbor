FFTbor computes number of delta-neighbours and the partition function
of delta-neighbours.

Type 'FFTbor --help' for help on the input format.

To compile the program run 'make' and then 'make install', but before
doing so ensure two things:

1) Ensure libRNA.a is in the libpath for the machine.
2) Change BINDIR in the Makefile to the directory where the binary 
should install (usually ~/bin or /usr/local/bin).

Files:

main.c - the main program file, reads input and prints output

delta.c, delta.h - the algorithm implementation

misc.c, misc.h - a few additional functions and global variables

energy_const.h,
energy_par.h,
params.h        - three h-files from Vienna RNA, these define energy 
                  parameters.

rna_turner1999.par,
rna_turner2004.par - yhe energy parameters (in the Vienna 2.x format)

libRNA.a - Vienna RNA library file, this file is not included in this
           tar-ball, but is generated by compiling the Vienna RNA package

Makefile - the makefile for this program

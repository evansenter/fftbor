FFTbor computes number of delta-neighbours and the partition function
of delta-neighbours.

Type 'FFTbor --help' for help on the input format.

To compile the program run 'make' and then 'make install', but before
doing so modify two lines in the Makefile. Change LDFLAGS to the
directory where you have libRNA.a and change BINDIR to the directory
where you want the RNAbor to be installed.

Files:

main.c - the main program file, reads input and prints output

delta.c, delta.h - the algorithm implementation

misc.c, misc.h - a few additional functions and global variables

energy_const.h,
energy_par.h,
params.h        - three h-files from Vienna RNA, these define energy 
                  parameters.

energy.par - The energy parameters.

libRNA.a - Vienna RNA library file, this file is not included in this
           tar-ball, but is included in the Vienna RNA package.

Makefile - The makefile

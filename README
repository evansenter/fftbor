FFTbor2D
________________________________________________________________

FFTbor2D computes all Boltzmann factors and ensemble free energy of k,l-neighbors
of an input sequence and two input structures, where k and l are the (resp.)
base pair distances from the provided input structures.

USING THE CODE
________________________________________________________________

FFTbor2D [options] sequence structure_1 structure_2

FFTbor2D [options] filename
where filename is a file of the format:
	>comment (optional line)
	sequence
	secondary structure (1)
	secondary structure (2)
  
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
________________________________________________________________

Options include the following:
-E	energyfile,    the default is rna_turner_1.8.5.par in this executable's directory. Must be the name of a file with all energy parameters (in the same format as used in Vienna RNA).
-T	temperature,   the default is 37 degrees Celsius (unless an energyfile with parameters for a different temperature is used.
-P	precision,     the default is 8, indicates the precision of the probabilities Z_k / Z to be returned (0-9, 0 disables precision handling).
-R	row length,    the default is 100, takes an integer 0 < R <= 100 that describes the dimensions of the 2D matrix in terms of the percentage sequence length.
-M	matrix format, the default is disabled, presents output in a matrix format instead of a column format.
-S      simple output, the default is disabled, presents output in column format, for non-zero entries only with no header output (columns are: k, l, p(Z_{k,l}/Z), -RTln(Z_{k,l})).

INSTALLATION
________________________________________________________________

To compile the program run 'make && make install', but before
doing so modify two lines in the Makefile. Change LDFLAGS to the
directory where you have libRNA.a and change BINDIR to the directory
where you want the FFTbor2D to be installed.

ANNOTATED FILE LIST
________________________________________________________________

Files:

main.cpp                   - the main program file, reads input and prints output
partition.cpp, partition.h - the algorithm implementation
misc.cpp, misc.h           - a few additional functions and global variables
energy_const.h,
energy_par.h,
params.h                   - three h-files from Vienna RNA, these define energy 
                     parameters.
rna_turner_1.8.5.par         - The energy parameters.
libRNA.a                   - Vienna RNA library file, this file is not included in this
                     source, but is included in the Vienna RNA package. This 
                     implementation requires ViennaRNA >= 2.0
Makefile                   - The makefile

# FFTbor

FFTbor computes number of delta-neighbours and the partition function of delta-neighbours.

Type `FFTbor --help` for help on the input format.

## Dependencies

This software depends on the presence of the following programs:

1. A valid C++ compiler with OpenMP support (developed using GCC 4.8 but should support any reasonable C++98 compiler)
2. CMake (>= 2.6, to generate the Makefile)
3. [FFTW (= 3.3.x)](http://www.fftw.org/)
4. `libRNA.a` from the [ViennaRNA package (= 2.x)](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/)

## Installation

To compile the program using CMake, perform the following commands:

    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    make
    make install
    
### Installation Notes:

* If `libRNA.a` is in a non-standard location, you can specify its path with the `-CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` flag.
  * See this [list of CMake environment flags](http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables#Environment_Variables) for more details.
* The `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag is not strictly necessary, and uses `/usr/local` as a default. 
* `make install` may need administrator privileges, depending on the permissions of your target install prefix. 
* CMake >= 2.6 is required to generate the system-appropriate Makefile.

## Relevant Files

* main.c - the main program file, reads input and prints output.
* delta.c, delta.h - the algorithm implementation.
* misc.c, misc.h - a few additional functions and global variables.
* energy\_const.h, energy_par.h, params.h - three h-files from ViennaRNA, these define energy parameters.
* rna\_turner1999.par, rna\_turner2004.par - the energy parameters (in the Vienna 2.x format).
* libRNA.a - Vienna RNA library file, this file is not included in this tar-ball, but is generated by compiling the Vienna RNA package.
* CMakeLists.txt - the CMake manifest for this package.
